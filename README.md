# math

Growing mathematics structures and components library for Java.

I've been teaching myself abstract algebra, and it fascinates me!
Right now, I am working on group- and ring-like structures.
I plan on adding more later (thinking logic operations).
If the library grows large enough, I will probably split it into multiple modules.

The original goal was to provide abstractions for my [crypto](https://github.com/oliveryasuna/math) library, but I imagine I will expand upon this library after
working on groups and rings.

This is **not** an alternative to or replacement for [commons-math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/).
